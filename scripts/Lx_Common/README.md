# Lx_Common

This is my personal API library that I use across all my projects. Started this because I was tired of copy-pasting the same functions everywhere.

## What's in here

Common utility functions and helpers that I find myself needing in every script I write. Nothing fancy, just stuff that works.

## Functions

*Will update this list as I add more functions to the library*

- More functions coming soon...

## Usage

Just drop the files you need into your project. Most functions are standalone so you can pick and choose.

## Notes

- Tested with my setup, your mileage may vary
- Feel free to use but no guarantees 
- If something breaks, let me know
